# efcore-multi-tenant
Project fork https://github.com/rsantosdev/efcore-multi-tenant and implemented in your live (https://youtu.be/0ogs8s8K3sU).

I made a POC making some adaptations for my needs, using Postgres as a test database.
I emphasize that in this project no software architecture was addressed, and everything was implemented only for testing purposes.
